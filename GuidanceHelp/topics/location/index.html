		<h1>Setting Your Location</h1>
		<p>Setting your location is key to getting the correct prayer times. After you enter in your location
		press "Set..." and then wait for Guidance to display a checkmark next to your location. Guidance will
		also automatically correct the location name to the full name it received from Google Maps, so if the 
		name it returns is not correct, please try to find your location with a different search term. 
		Guidance uses Google Maps to look up the Latitude and Longitude for a location. If you are unable
		to find your location you may enter in the manual coordinates in the format "Latitude, Longitude".
		</p>
		
		<p>After you set your location, be sure to set the correct time zone. If the location you entered has the same time zone
		as that used by your system, then check "Use system time zone." This is the best option to use if possible, as it will
		automatically apply the correct daylight savings times. If the location you entered is in a different time zone, 
		deselect "Use system time zone" and then select the correct daylight savings and time zone settings. Please be aware that
		it will be up to you to change the daylight savings option on the appropriate day if you choose this option.</p>
