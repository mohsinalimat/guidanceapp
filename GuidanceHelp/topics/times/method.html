		<h1>Calculation Method</h1>
		<p>The calculation method drop down allows you to select a commonly used calculation method 
		or to specify your custom method. The calculation methods specify a Sunrise angle and a Sunset angle which allow
		Guidance to correctly calculate your Fajr and Isha times. The sunrise and sunset angles allow Guidance to figure out
		how long after the sunset will it be Isha time and how long before the sunrise is it Fajr time.</p>
		
		<p>Below are the descriptions for the different calculation methods. The list of areas in which the calculation methods are commonly used
		are listed for informational purposes and should not be taken as an authoritative source. To get the most accurate results try each 
		calculation method and compare the prayer times to that of your local Mosque.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you know the exact sunrise and sunset angle your location uses then you can create a custom
		method by choosing "Other..." from the list and entering in the sunrise and sunset values, however you should only
		use this option if you are completely certain what the correct sunrise and sunset angles for your location are.</p>
