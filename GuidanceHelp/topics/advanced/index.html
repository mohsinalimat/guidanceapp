		<h1>Statically Adjusting Prayer Times (Advanced)</h1>
		<p>If you notice that the prayer times in Guidance are consistently differing from your local prayer times by a fixed number of minutes, then it is possible to set a static adjustment for each prayer time.</p>

		<p><b>Note:</b> Static adjustments are limited to a maximum adjustment of 15 minutes. If you find that the prayer times differ more than 15 minutes you should instead try to select a more appropriate <a href="../times/method.html">calculation method</a>.</p>
		
		<p>To adjust a prayer time:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Choose Preferences &gt; Advanced</li>
			<li>Click the drop down next to the prayer time you want to adjust.</li>
			<li>Select the number of minutes you wish to adjust the prayer time by.</li>
		</ol>
